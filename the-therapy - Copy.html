                While there is a component of sitting across from one another talking, this modality
                also brings the energetic & physical body into the experience. Throughout the session
                layers of energy and body awareness are supported. This happens through different
                mindfulness practices, including, meditation, mantra, physical awareness, breath-work,
                and any other offerings, when applied skillfully, can offer clarity and relief.

                    An opportunity to practice presence in connection with another (with support). At the
                    start of our relationship we will explore current concerns, historical experiences and
                    the possibilities of how the work can assist healing. I will take holistic history
                    including information about your family of origin, recognized trauma (both physical and
                    emotional), health (nutrition, conditions, etc.) and relationships. Sessions are built
                    around supporting well-being and tracking anything coming up that could be interrupting
                    your state of wellness.

                    The short answer is: Yes. Memories may appear to be restricted to the realm of
                    cognition, but the emotions tied to these memories express as a whole body experience.
                    In fact, many of our large and small traumas occur pre-verbally as a wholly emotional
                    (body) experience. By accessing these emotions through the body and being present with
                    the energy past experiences have left behind in our physical beings we can hear and,
                    therefore, relieve them.

                    It’s true that some somatic techniques we’ll use are more fully experienced while lying
                    down, so we do make use of a massage-style table when that arises. Unlike other
                    body-work therapies, however, nearly all of the work we do will be communicated through
                    verbal cues.
